# TCSS360_DiscordBot
## Meet Tom. A friendly bot for your Discord server.

First you'll need to sign up on Discord to create a profile. In general, you will need one to use a bot's functionality, including Tom. If you already have one and can access Discord, skip steps 1 through 3.

  1. Go to https://discordapp.com/
  2. Register an account (typically within the login screen)
  3. You can either download the Discord client or access Discord in your browser.

Now to get Tom in your server. You'll need to own or be in a server where you have management permissions.
