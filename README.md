# TCSS360_DiscordBot
## Meet Tom. A friendly bot for your Discord server.

First you'll need to sign up on Discord to create a profile. In general, you will need one to use a bot's functionality, including Tom. If you already have one and can access Discord, skip steps 1 through 3.

  1.  Go to https://discordapp.com/
  2.  Register an account (typically within the login screen).
  3.  You can either download the Discord client or access Discord in your browser.

Now to get Tom in your server. You'll need to own or be in a server where you have management permissions. 

To make a server, simply click the (+) icon on the left of the Discord interface, hit "create", select a region, and enter a name for the server. Voila.

If you are already in a server and have permission to manage it, don't worry about creating another one

To add Tom to your server:
  
  4.  Go to https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=372528661020278787&scope=bot
  5.  If it tells you to log in, do so. It will prompt you to select one of your servers where you want Tom added.
  6.  You should now see Tom's friendly face. Click the drop down menu and select the server you want him added.
  
Tom should be on your server after a few seconds. Whenever Tom is online...

* Type "/help" to view available commands.
* For World of Warcraft players, you can type (replacing character and server with theirs):
  * "/ilevel character server" to display a player's basic info and item level.
  * "/mplus character server" to display a player's Mythic Plus statistics.
  * "/wow character server" to display both of that.       
* For Hearthstone players, type (replacing cardname with... a card name) "/card cardname" to display a collectible card. 
* He keeps tabs on the users of the server, preventing them from spamming. To stay unmuted, make sure to avoid:
  * Posting the exact same message twice in a row.
  * Posting 5 messages within 10 seconds.
* The server admin will have to manually unmute muted users (A server "role" will be assigned and unassigned).
* Expect a special message from Tom every Wednesday at 12:00 AM.

Enjoy Tom's company.
